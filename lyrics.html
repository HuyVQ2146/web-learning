            <span>Once upon a younger year</span>
            <span>When all our shadows disappeared</span>
            <span>The animals inside came out to play</span>
            <span>Went face to face with all our fears</span>
            <span>Learned our lessons through the tears</span>
            <span>Made memories we knew would never fade</span>

            <span>One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away"</span>
            <span>He took me in his arms, I heard him say</span>
            <span>"When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days</span>
            <span>Think of me if ever you're afraid"</span>

            <span>He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind</span>
            <span>So live a life you will remember"</span>
            <span>My father told me when I was just a child</span>
            <span>"These are the nights that never die"</span>
            <span>My father told me</span>

            <span>"When thunderclouds start pouring down</span>
            <span>Light a fire they can't put out</span>
            <span>Carve your name into those shining stars"</span>
            <span>He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores</span>
            <span>Don't forsake this life of yours</span>
            <span>I'll guide you home no matter where you are"</span>

            <span>One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away"</span>
            <span>When I was just a kid, I heard him say</span>
            <span>"When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days</span>
            <span>Think of me if ever you're afraid"</span>

            <span>He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind</span>
            <span>So live a life you will remember"</span>
            <span>My father told me when I was just a child</span>
            <span>"These are the nights that never die"</span>
            <span>My father told me</span>

            <span>"These are the nights that never die"</span>
            <span>My father told me</span>

            <span>My father told me</span>
